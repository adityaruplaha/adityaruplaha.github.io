## Research

Just started out on my college life, so the list is still short. Hope to grow it quickly though!

- Bayesian Learning (under Prof. Kiranmoy Das, ISI Kolkata): _Report WIP_
- _(Private ongoing project)_

## Personal Programming Projects

### Actively maintained:

- [JEEMainAnswerKeyChecker](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/JEEMainAnswerKeyChecker)

### Completed(ish):

- [AlgoSpeedTest](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/AlgoSpeedTest)
- [CoinCounter](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/CoinCounter)
- ...and many smaller projects.

These were part of my school life, though not strictly part of the curriculum:

- [atman](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/atman)
- [High School Projects](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/adityaruplaha-school-projects)
- [High School Website](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/adityaruplaha-school-website)

### Unmaintained & Archived:

These I hope to get back to someday:

- [OpenGL Engine](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/OpenGL-Engine)

And these are projects I've basically left:

- [OpenGL Practice](https://github.com/adityaruplaha/OpenGL-Practice)
- ...and many ideas that never made it into final code.

Still have a lot of ideas that I hope to turn into code someday.
