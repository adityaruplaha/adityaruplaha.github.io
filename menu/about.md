Hi!
I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Statistics at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, with a knack for programming and lots of love for FOSS.

I want to learn more about about theoretical CS, data science, AI/ML, etc. I do web scraping, data aggregation, and data visualisation for fun now and then. Also interested in cybersecurity, network engineering and cryptography.

I have been programming for around 7 years, with my primary language being C++. While I'm not exactly a full-stack developer, I am familar with the concepts ranging from network design, UI/UX, database management, web development, etc. I am also familar with DevOps and industry best practices. Occasionally, I also try my hand at competetive programming. Currently, I'm a 2-star programmer on CodeChef.

Here's the gist of my CV:
