The best way to get in touch is to [send me an email](mailto:me@adityaruplaha.me).

Otherwise, you can also [send me a message](https://t.me/adityaruplaha) over on Telegram.

I rarely, if ever, use Instagram or Twitter, so contacting me on those platforms is of no use.

## PKI

I manage my own Public Key Infrastructure using [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl).

- [Root CA](/assets/pki/rootca-adityaruplaha.pem)
- [Personal Signing Key](/assets/pki/signing-adityaruplaha.pem)

I also have a [PGP key](/assets/pki/pgpkey-adityaruplaha.asc).
