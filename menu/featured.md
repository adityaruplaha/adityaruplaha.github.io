## A few projects I've worked with...

There's a few projects I've been associated with in the past, but because of time constraints, haven't been able to work on recently.
However, they're still very much worth checking out.

## SciAstra

I'd like to express by gratitude towards [SciAstra](https://sciastra.com). I was a student of their maiden batch, which was basically just a lot of PDFs, exams (in the form of Google Forms) and interaction sessions, before they even had a formal name. As of August 2022, they're starting with their second yearlong _proper_ batch of students, with incredible results from the first one.

I was a mentor in many of their courses during that year and still try to show up in sessions from time to time to interact with the current batch. I really believe they're doing a great job of promoting science research in India, this is not a paid endorsement. Please check them out, and spread the message to anyone whbo you think may be interested.

I was once interviewed by them, you can check that out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58qRLRhtJz8).

## Tools I use...

### Trello

Trello is a tool we use on a near-daily basis as part of our internal resource management at ISI. We, as a batch, use it for practically everything from announcements to important resources to class notes. I strongly recommend Trello as a tool to organize both your personal and professional life. [Check it out.](https://trello.com).

### VS Code

All my software work, including building this website, is done on VS Code. Its intuitive, easy-on-the-eyes UI, paired with the myriad of functionalities you can add via the thousands of available extensions more than makes up for the relatively large resource footprint for me. Since I primarily write Python, R, or TypeScript these days anyway, I have never needed a full-fledged IDE.

### Arch Linux

My main machine currently is an Acer Nitro AN515-57 running Arch Linux. I repurposed my old desktop into a server, also running Arch. It offers me a pretty bleeding-edge yet stable system with access to the AUR. What more could I want?

### ...and more.
