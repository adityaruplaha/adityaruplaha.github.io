So yeah, 6 months have passed. I [said]({% post_url 2022-01-31-first-post %}) that I would try to keep this regularly up to date.
Needless to say, I failed. Miserably.

A lot has happened in the last few months. This was the first offline semester of college, and it was honestly crazy.
Coursework was difficult as is, add to that ISI's dynamic social life, and you have an absolutely wild ride.

We had our own Freshers' (Mas Fresco 2022) on 16th March 2022, along with our seniors, cuz they also hadn't got theirs thanks to COVID-19.
We had a batch treat as well (thanks seniors <3) on 10th May 2022, which is the title image for this post.

On 8th June 2022, the semester finally got over, and we went back home for a break. I mostly spent the time cooking, and pursuing a project (see [here](/projects)), reading, watching Star Wars, and a bunch of misc stuff. Thought about updating this site, but never got around to it. It was like the break wasn't even there.

These months were also spent reconnecting with old friends, and forming new connections.
The central image on the above collage is from outing with my friends from back in my FIITJEE days. 
The one on the bottom right was from an outing with school friends.

In the beginning of August, back to ISI it was. Time to begin second year of college already. In hindsight, the past year almost feels like it was gone before it began. Still, I'm thankful to the people who made it the great year it was. 

On 15th August, we had a programme on the occassion of [75 years of independence](https://amritmahotsav.nic.in/). The bottom left and bottom centre inages in the collage are from that day; me with my homies backstage.

On 22nd August, a new batch joined ISI. Unfortunately I don't have pictures to post on this occassion. Still struggle to believe that I have juniors now. Oh well, time to plan [their Freshers'](/isi-internal/mas-fresco-b22), I guess. I wonder what we'll call it.

Anyway, signing off for now, will try to keep this updated, though I'm pretty sure no one's reading it. Restructured the site a lot, should be easier to work on it. Bye!
