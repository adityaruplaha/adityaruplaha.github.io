Hey, welcome to my new website!
This is just a place for me to showcase my work and share my thoughts and ideas.

Feel free to look around, I've added a couple pages already. Still got lots to do though.
Also, you can switch between light and dark themes using the button on the bottom left corner.

And if you're a bit confused, this is not exactly the first post, a few got carried over from [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/), the Jekyll theme this website is based on. So, a big thanks to Len Paul for this theme. And thanks to Jekyll and GitHub Pages as well for helping make this website possible.

This post isn't much to look at, so if you want to see what this theme can do check out [Text and Formatting]({% post_url 2014-01-01-text-formatting-examples %}). This is just the beginning, and I'll try to keep this website updated regularly! :D

You can learn more about me on the [About](/about) page.
